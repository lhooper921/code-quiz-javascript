## Description
The goal of this project was to create a Javascript quiz that meets the following acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

This application contains 7 questions regarding Javascript. When an incorrect answer is selected, the selected button becomes dark red and 10 seconds are deducted from the countdown timer. When a correct answer is selected, the selected button turns gold and no seconds are deducted from the clock. The quiz ends when either all seven questions have been answered or when the timer runs out. The user score is equal to the remaining seconds at the time of quiz end. Once the quiz ends, the user can enter their initials to save their score on the highscores page. They can then try the quiz again, navigate to the home page, or view all high scores.
